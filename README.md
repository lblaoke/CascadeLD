# Lane Detection and Classification using Cascaded CNNs

This is the repository of the paper "[Lane Detection and Classification using Cascaded CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01294)". Only the inference code is public, and it is documented using a Jupyter Notebook. To see the system in action, please open [the notebook](https://github.com/fabvio/Cascade-LD/blob/master/main.ipynb).
